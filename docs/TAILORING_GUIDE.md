## Why Tailoring Matters

### The Numbers

- **Tailored CVs** get 2-3x more interviews than generic ones
- **75% of CVs** are rejected by ATS before human review
- **Recruiters spend 6-7 seconds** on initial CV scan
- **60% of job requirements** are wish lists, not hard requirements

### What Hiring Managers Look For

When scanning CVs, they're asking:
1. **Does this person have the core skills we need?** (keyword matching)
2. **Have they done similar work before?** (relevant experience)
3. **Will they fit our team?** (culture indicators)
4. **Can they communicate clearly?** (CV quality)

Tailoring helps you answer "YES" to all four questions.

## The 80/20 Approach

**Don't rewrite your entire CV for each job.** Instead:

- **80% stays the same:** Core experience, achievements, education
- **20% gets tailored:** Skills section, achievement emphasis, keywords

### What to Tailor (15-20 minutes per application)

✅ **Skills section** - Reorder to match job requirements
✅ **Professional summary** - Add role-specific keywords
✅ **Achievement emphasis** - Highlight most relevant 2-3 per job
✅ **Keywords throughout** - Mirror job description language
✅ **Cover letter** - Always customize this

❌ **Don't change:**
- Core work history
- Education
- Certifications
- Basic contact info

## Step-by-Step Tailoring Process

### Step 1: Analyze the Job Description (5 minutes)

**Extract three things:**

1. **Must-Have Skills** (usually in "Requirements" section)
2. **Nice-to-Have Skills** (usually in "Preferred" or "Bonus" section)
3. **Key Responsibilities** (what you'll actually do)

**Example Job Posting:**

```
Software Engineer - Acme Corp

Requirements:
- 2+ years experience with React and TypeScript
- Strong understanding of REST APIs
- Experience with Git and CI/CD
- Bachelor's in CS or equivalent

Preferred:
- Experience with Node.js backend
- Knowledge of AWS
- Agile/Scrum experience

Responsibilities:
- Build and maintain web applications
- Collaborate with design and product teams
- Write tests and participate in code reviews
- Improve application performance
```

**Your Analysis:**

Must-Haves:
- React ✓ (I have this)
- TypeScript ✓ (I have this)
- REST APIs ✓ (I have this)
- Git/CI/CD ✓ (I have this)

Nice-to-Haves:
- Node.js ✓ (I have this)
- AWS ~ (I know basics, need to emphasize)
- Agile ✓ (I have this)

Keywords to include:
- React, TypeScript, REST APIs, Git, CI/CD
- Web applications, code reviews, testing
- Performance, collaboration

### Step 2: Update Your Skills Section (3 minutes)

**Before (Generic):**
```yaml
Programming Languages:
  - Python
  - JavaScript
  - Go
  - TypeScript
  - Rust
```

**After (Tailored to React/TypeScript role):**
```yaml
Programming Languages:
  - JavaScript/TypeScript  # Moved to top, combined
  - React  # Made explicit
  - Python
  - Go
  - Node.js  # Added because it's in "Preferred"
```

**Principle:** Put their must-haves at the top of your skills list.

### Step 3: Add Role-Specific Keywords (2 minutes)

Scan your achievements and add keywords from the job description where natural.

**Before:**
> "Built customer dashboard with modern frontend framework, serving 10K+ users"

**After (for React job):**
> "Built customer dashboard with React and TypeScript, integrating REST APIs to serve 10K+ users"

**Before:**
> "Automated deployments"

**After (for job mentioning CI/CD):**
> "Automated deployments with CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions"

### Step 4: Emphasize Relevant Achievements (5 minutes)

You have 10 achievements. The job cares about 3-4. Make those 3-4 prominent.

**For a Frontend-Heavy Role, emphasize:**
- UI/UX work
- Performance optimization
- Component libraries
- Accessibility

**For a Backend-Heavy Role, emphasize:**
- API design
- Database optimization
- Scalability
- System architecture

**For a DevOps Role, emphasize:**
- Infrastructure automation
- CI/CD pipelines
- Monitoring & observability
- Cost optimization

### Step 5: Update Professional Summary (3 minutes)

Your CV should have a 2-3 sentence summary at the top (or in your tagline). Tailor it.

**Generic:**
> "Software Developer with 2 years experience building web applications"

**Tailored to React/TypeScript role:**
> "Software Developer with 2 years experience building production React applications with TypeScript, focusing on component architecture and performance optimization"

**Tailored to DevOps role:**
> "DevOps Engineer with 2 years experience automating CI/CD pipelines and managing cloud infrastructure, reducing deployment time and improving reliability"

## Decoding Job Descriptions

### Understanding Requirements

**"Must Have" vs Reality:**

| What They Say | What They Mean | Your Response |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| "5+ years experience" | "We want someone experienced" | Apply if you have 3+ and strong skills |
| "Expert in React" | "You should know React well" | Apply if you've built production apps |
| "Strong CS fundamentals" | "You should understand algorithms/data structures" | Mention your education or self-study |
| "Bachelor's degree required" | "We prefer degrees but..." | Apply anyway if you have strong experience |

**Junior Developers: If you meet 50% of "requirements", apply.**

### Red Flags in Job Descriptions

⚠️ **Warning signs:**
- Listing 15+ "required" technologies (they're not all required)
- "Rockstar", "Ninja", "Guru" in title (potentially immature culture)
- Responsibilities include things from 3 different roles
- Vague description with no technical details
- "Fast-paced environment" + "Wear many hats" (might be chaotic)

✅ **Good signs:**
- Clear, specific responsibilities
- Realistic tech stack (5-7 core technologies)
- Mention of mentorship or growth opportunities
- Details about team structure
- Clear product/mission description

### Keywords That Signal Culture

**Learning-Friendly Culture:**
- "Mentorship"
- "Growth opportunities"
- "Learning stipend"
- "Onboarding program"
- "Pair programming"

**Collaboration-Focused:**
- "Cross-functional teams"
- "Agile/Scrum"
- "Code reviews"
- "Collaborative environment"

**Quality-Focused:**
- "Test-driven development"
- "High code quality standards"
- "Documentation"
- "Technical excellence"

**Fast-Moving Startup:**
- "Move fast"
- "Scrappy"
- "Wearing many hats"
- "Early stage"

## Keyword Optimization

### How to Find Keywords

1. **Copy the entire job description** into a text file
2. **Highlight all technical terms:** Languages, frameworks, tools, practices
3. **Note repeated phrases:** If they mention "scalability" 3 times, it's important
4. **Check the company's tech blog:** What do they actually use?

### Where to Add Keywords

**High-Impact Locations (ATS scans these first):**
1. Skills section
2. Professional summary / tagline
3. Recent job achievements
4. Project descriptions

**Medium-Impact Locations:**
5. Older job achievements
6. Education (e.g., "Focused on distributed systems")
7. Certifications

### Natural vs Forced Keywords

❌ **Keyword stuffing (ATS penalizes this):**
> "Python developer with Python experience building Python applications using Python"

✅ **Natural keyword inclusion:**
> "Built customer analytics platform with Python and Django, processing 1M+ data points daily"

✅ **Use variations:**
- "JavaScript" and "JS"
- "CI/CD" and "Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment"
- "Amazon Web Services" and "AWS"

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "I Don't Have All the Required Skills"

**Situation:** Job requires React, TypeScript, AWS. You have React, JavaScript, no AWS.

**Solution:**
1. **Apply anyway** (if you meet 50%+)
2. **Emphasize what you have:**
   - "2 years production React experience"
   - "Strong JavaScript fundamentals (TypeScript is essentially JavaScript + types)"
3. **Show willingness to learn:**
   - In cover letter: "Eager to expand my cloud knowledge with AWS"
   - Mention any cloud basics: "Familiar with cloud concepts through GCP experience"
4. **Start learning the missing skill:**
   - Take a quick AWS tutorial
   - Deploy a personal project to AWS
   - Now you can honestly say: "Currently learning AWS, deployed first serverless application"

### Scenario 2: "My Experience Doesn't Match Exactly"

**Situation:** Job is for frontend, but you're primarily backend developer.

**Solution:**
1. **Find transferable experience:**
   - Built APIs → "Designed APIs consumed by frontend, understand frontend needs"
   - Fixed bugs → "Debugged full-stack issues including frontend"
   - Worked on team → "Collaborated with frontend developers, reviewed React PRs"

2. **Reframe what you have:**
   - "While my recent role focused on backend, I have frontend experience including [X, Y, Z]"
   - Highlight any frontend work, even if small

3. **Show learning:**
   - Build a React project this week
   - "Currently building personal projects with React to deepen frontend expertise"

### Scenario 3: "Entry-Level Job Requires 3 Years Experience"

**Situation:** Job says "Junior" but requires "3+ years experience."

**Solution:**
1. **Apply anyway** - It's often negotiable
2. **Count all relevant experience:**
   - Internships count
   - Personal projects count (be honest about it)
   - Open source contributions count
   - Bootcamp intensive hours can translate to months of experience

3. **Reframe in cover letter:**
   - "While my professional experience is 1 year, I've been coding for 3 years including personal projects and contributions to open source"

4. **Show equivalent expertise:**
   - Prove you can do the work through strong projects and achievements

### Scenario 4: "Job Lists 20 Technologies"

**Situation:** Job requires React, Vue, Angular, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, AWS, GCP, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, etc...

**Solution:**
1. **Identify core vs nice-to-have:**
   - Core (probably): React, TypeScript, AWS, Docker
   - Nice-to-have: Everything else

2. **Match what you can:**
   - Emphasize any overlaps
   - Show depth in 2-3 core technologies rather than breadth in 20

3. **Look for patterns:**
   - React + Vue + Angular = "They want someone who knows frontend frameworks"
   - AWS + GCP + Azure = "They want cloud experience (any cloud)"

4. **Be honest:**
   - Don't claim you "know" 20 technologies
   - "Deep expertise in React and TypeScript, with exposure to Vue"
