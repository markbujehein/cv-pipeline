## Tips for Adapting These Examples

1. **Keep the structure, change the details:**
   - Maintain the "Action + What + Result" format
   - Replace technologies, numbers, and context with your actual experience

2. **Be honest:**
   - Never fabricate numbers or experience
   - If your project had 10 users, say 10 (and focus on learning/implementation)

3. **Adjust scale appropriately:**
   - Junior developers shouldn't claim they "architected enterprise systems"
   - But you can "designed and built a scalable application" for personal projects

4. **Emphasize different aspects based on role:**
   - Startup: speed, iteration, wearing multiple hats
   - Enterprise: scale, reliability, collaboration
   - Consultancy: variety, client communication, diverse technologies

5. **Make it yours:**
   - Add specific details that make it uniquely your story
   - Mention specific challenges you overcame
   - Highlight what makes your experience different

## Remember

These are examples, not scripts. Your real experience, told authentically with measurable impact, is always more compelling than perfectly worded generic achievements.

**Focus on what you actually did and the real impact it had.**
