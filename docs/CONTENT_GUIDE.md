## The Golden Rule

**Your CV is not a job description. It's a highlight reel of your impact.**

❌ Bad: "Responsible for developing features"
✅ Good: "Built 3 high-traffic features used by 50K+ daily users, reducing load time by 40%"

## Writing Achievements That Matter

### The Formula

```
Action Verb + What You Did + How You Did It (optional) + Measurable Result
```

### Examples by Experience Level

#### Entry Level / Junior (0-2 years)

You might not have massive metrics, but you have:
- Learning speed
- Initiative
- Code quality
- Collaboration

**Good Examples:**
- "Refactored legacy authentication module with 2,000+ lines, reducing technical debt and improving test coverage from 20% to 85%"
- "Built automated testing pipeline that caught 15+ critical bugs before production, saving 10+ hours of manual QA weekly"
- "Contributed 50+ PRs to open-source project, with 3 features merged into core library used by 10K+ developers"
- "Created internal documentation portal that reduced new developer onboarding time from 2 weeks to 3 days"

#### Mid Level (2-5 years)

**Good Examples:**
- "Led migration of monolithic app to microservices architecture, improving deployment frequency from monthly to daily"
- "Designed and implemented caching layer reducing API response time by 60% and database load by 40%"
- "Mentored 3 junior developers, with all promoted within 12 months through structured code review process"
- "Automated deployment pipeline reducing release time from 4 hours to 15 minutes, enabling daily releases"

### Action Verbs by Role Type

**Software Developer:**
Built, Developed, Engineered, Designed, Implemented, Refactored, Optimized, Architected, Created, Shipped

**DevOps Engineer:**
Automated, Orchestrated, Streamlined, Deployed, Migrated, Scaled, Monitored, Secured, Optimized, Configured

**Cloud Engineer:**
Architected, Provisioned, Migrated, Scaled, Secured, Optimized, Designed, Implemented, Automated, Maintained

## The STAR Method

For complex achievements, use STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result):

**Example:**

**Situation:** Legacy deployment process took 4 hours and required manual steps
**Task:** Needed to enable faster feature releases without increasing risk
**Action:** Designed and implemented automated CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, Docker, and Kubernetes
**Result:** Reduced deployment time to 15 minutes, enabled 50+ deployments per month (up from 4), zero production incidents from deployment errors

**On Your CV (condensed):**
"Automated deployment pipeline with GitHub Actions, Docker, and Kubernetes, reducing release time from 4 hours to 15 minutes and increasing deployment frequency 12x"

## Common Mistakes Junior Developers Make

### 1. Listing Technologies Without Context

❌ "Used React, Node.js, MongoDB, Docker"
✅ "Built full-stack e-commerce platform with React frontend and Node.js backend, handling 10K+ transactions monthly"

### 2. Focusing on Duties Instead of Impact

❌ "Responsible for maintaining CI/CD pipeline"
✅ "Improved CI/CD pipeline reliability from 70% to 99%, eliminating 40+ hours of monthly debugging"

### 3. Being Too Vague

❌ "Improved application performance"
✅ "Optimized database queries and implemented Redis caching, reducing page load time from 3s to 0.5s"

### 4. Using Passive Voice

❌ "Was responsible for the development of..."
✅ "Developed..."

### 5. Including Obvious Skills

Don't waste space on "Familiar with Git" or "Used Microsoft Office". Everyone knows these.

## Quantifying Your Impact

### If You Don't Have Numbers

You can still quantify! Consider:

**Time saved:**
- "Reduced deployment time by 75%"
- "Cut onboarding time in half"

**Quality improvements:**
- "Increased test coverage from 40% to 90%"
- "Reduced bug reports by 60% in first quarter"

**Scale:**
- "Built API handling 1M+ requests daily"
- "Managed infrastructure supporting 50+ microservices"

**Frequency:**
- "Delivered 15+ features across 3 quarters"
- "Participated in 100+ code reviews"

**Scope:**
- "Refactored 5,000+ lines of legacy code"
- "Created documentation covering 20+ services"

### The "So What?" Test

For each achievement, ask "So what?"

"Built a dashboard" → So what?
"Built analytics dashboard that helped product team identify top 3 user pain points, leading to 25% increase in user retention"

## Tailoring to Job Descriptions

### The 60/40 Rule

- 60% should be your core, transferable skills
- 40% should be tailored to the specific role

### How to Tailor Effectively

1. **Extract Keywords from Job Description**
   - Technologies mentioned (e.g., "Kubernetes", "React", "Python")
   - Soft skills (e.g., "collaboration", "mentorship", "ownership")
   - Business outcomes (e.g., "scalability", "reliability", "user experience")

2. **Match Your Experience to Their Needs**

If they want: "Experience with microservices architecture"
Your achievement: "Led migration to microservices architecture, decomposing monolith into 12 independent services"

If they want: "Strong collaboration skills"
Your achievement: "Collaborated with product, design, and QA teams to deliver 5 major features in Q3, all on time"

3. **Use Their Language**

If they say "full-stack", use "full-stack" (not "front-end and back-end")
If they say "DevOps", use "DevOps" (not "infrastructure")

### Example: Same Person, Two Jobs

**Job A: Startup looking for "fast-moving full-stack developer"**
- "Shipped 8 features in 6 weeks, iterating based on user feedback to achieve product-market fit"
- "Built MVP in 3 weeks using React and Node.js, securing $500K seed funding"

**Job B: Enterprise looking for "scalable solutions and reliability"**
- "Designed fault-tolerant system handling 10M+ requests daily with 99.95% uptime"
- "Implemented comprehensive testing strategy achieving 90% code coverage and zero production incidents in 6 months"

Same person, same experience, different emphasis.

## Keywords That Work

### ATS-Friendly Keywords by Role

**Software Developer:**
- Programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, etc.)
- Frameworks (React, Node.js, Django, Spring Boot)
- "Full-stack development", "API design", "Database optimization"
- "Agile", "CI/CD", "Git", "Code review"
- "Test-driven development", "Unit testing"

**DevOps Engineer:**
- "CI/CD", "GitOps", "Infrastructure as Code"
- Tools (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, Terraform)
- "Container orchestration", "Kubernetes", "Docker"
- "Automation", "Monitoring", "Observability"
- "Cloud platforms", "AWS", "GCP", "Azure"

**Cloud Engineer:**
- "Cloud architecture", "Multi-cloud", "Hybrid cloud"
- "AWS", "Azure", "GCP" (specific services: EC2, S3, Lambda, etc.)
- "Infrastructure as Code", "Terraform", "CloudFormation"
- "Scalability", "High availability", "Disaster recovery"
- "Cost optimization", "Security", "Compliance"

## Pro Tips for Junior Developers

### 1. Personal Projects Count

If you lack professional experience:
- Open source contributions are real work
- Personal projects that solve real problems are valuable
- Freelance/volunteer work demonstrates initiative

**Frame them professionally:**
"Built and deployed personal finance tracker with React and Firebase, used by 200+ users with 4.5-star rating"

### 2. Highlight Learning Speed

Juniors are hired for potential:
- "Learned Kubernetes and deployed production cluster within 2 weeks"
- "Self-taught Go, contributed to production codebase within first month"

### 3. Showcase Collaboration

Juniors need to demonstrate they can work with teams:
- "Actively participated in 50+ code reviews, improving code quality across team"
- "Paired with senior engineers on architecture decisions for 3 major features"

### 4. Emphasize Modern Practices

Show you understand professional development:
- "Wrote comprehensive tests achieving 85% coverage"
- "Implemented CI/CD pipeline following GitOps principles"
- "Documented all APIs with OpenAPI specification"

## The Review Checklist

Before finalizing your CV:

- [ ] Every achievement has a measurable result or impact
- [ ] Used active voice and strong action verbs
- [ ] Removed jargon that doesn't add value
- [ ] Tailored content to target role
- [ ] Included relevant keywords for ATS

## Remember

Your CV gets you the interview. The interview gets you the job.

The goal is not to list everything you've ever done - it's to make them think "I need to talk to this person."

**Focus on impact, not activity.**
**Show results, not responsibilities.**
**Tell a story, not a history.**
